# Rarity-Bot

This Discord server bot is to be used in conjunction with EA and CG's Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes game. Created by two college students, its primary function is to assist guilds with filling platoons for Territory Battles. Other uses for the bot include checking for seven star Han Solo (raid) and General Kenobi, if a guild was to limit the damage output of those character holders. This bot uses data from swgoh.gg, thus data may take up to 24 hours to update, and will not show accurate numbers if a player has the shards to upgrade a character, but has not done so. This bot is not associated with Star Wars, EA, Capital Games, SWGOH.gg, Lucasfilm, or Disney.
